‭ Description:‬
‭In this project, I used three different types of sorting algorithms to sort the data using the JAVA‬. The data was preprocessed to select only the data that had a history of‬
‭COVID-19 information. All of the files were in CSV format, so we used the Commons CSV‬
‭package by Apache to parse the CSV files.‬ Before sorting, the data was shuffled randomly using Java's default `Collection.shuffle`method.‬
‭I analyzed the time required to sort the data by each sorting method. We used all the obtained‬
‭COVID-19 case data for sorting, i.e., I had 1615925 pieces of data to sort. The results of them‬
‭sorting by ‘VAERSID’ is as follows:‬
Quick Sort‬-  The complexity of the quicksort algorithm in the average case is O(n logn). This‬
‭algorithm took 3699 ms to complete the sorting process.‬
Merge Sort‬- The complexity of the merge sort algorithm in the average case is O(n logn). This‬
‭algorithm took 2089ms to complete the sorting process.‬
Insertion Sort‬- The complexity of the insertion sort algorithm in the average case is O(n^2). This‬ algorithm took 9992331 ms, approximately about 3 hours to complete.‬‬
